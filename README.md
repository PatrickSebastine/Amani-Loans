# **Amani Loan Management Database**

# **1.0 Introduction**

This SQL query creates six tables: Customers, LoanOfficers, Loans, LoanApplications, LoanPayments, and LoanRepayments. These tables are related to each other using foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity between them.

The database design process involved the following steps:

**1.1 Identifying Entities and Attributes:**  
The first step was to identify the entities and attributes involved in the loan process, including customers, loans, loan applications, loan payments and repayments, loan officers, interest rates, and loan terms.

**1.2 Designing the Database Schema:**  
The second step was to design the database schema by creating tables for each entity and defining relationships between them.

**1.3 Defining Data Types:**  
The third step involved defining the data types for each attribute in the database schema, including specifying the data type, length, and any constraints or validation rules.

**1.4 Importing Data into Power BI:**  
After designing the database, the SQL Server Database was imported to be visualized for identifying trends and patterns in loan data. This would enable the management of Amani Loans to make informed decisions about loan approvals, interest rates, employment status, home ownership status, and loan terms, and how these attributes can affect loan repayment characteristics and performance.

**1.5 Future Usage of the Database:**  
Finally, as the management of Amani Loans makes everyday use of the management database, they may identify areas for improvement or optimization and reach out to me for feedback and comments to ensure that the database is performing at its best and meeting the needs of the loan business.
